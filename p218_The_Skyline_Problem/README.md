This problem is a classical mutant of "1D SegmentTree using RangeWrite", see [this note](https://www.yinxiang.com/everhub/note/b904af18-03fd-4dbc-a3d2-67a0daa1518e) and https://github.com/genxium/Leetcode/tree/master/p307_Range_Sum_Query_Mutable for some information. 

See https://github.com/genxium/Leetcode/blob/master/p57_Insert_Interval for a getting started to the "closure tracking" method.
