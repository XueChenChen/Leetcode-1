A similar problem but requires "covering" instead of "packing" is [p452_Minimum_Number_of_Arrows_to_Burst_Balloons](https://github.com/genxium/Leetcode/tree/master/p452_Minimum_Number_of_Arrows_to_Burst_Balloons).

A similar yet more difficult problem is [p630_Course_Schedule_III](https://github.com/genxium/Leetcode/tree/master/p630_Course_Schedule_III).
